# 🚀 Food Delivery CO₂ & Performance Analysis Dashboard

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes food delivery operations from two main perspectives:

1. **Operational Performance**  
   - Delivery time  
   - Distance  
   - Vehicle type  
   - Order type  
   - Customer ratings  

2. **Environmental Impact**  
   - CO₂ emissions per vehicle  
   - Packaging impact  
   - Distance-based emissions  
   - Overall environmental footprint  

The goal is to understand how delivery behavior affects sustainability and to provide insights that help reduce emissions.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following main fields:

- `Delivery_person_Age`  
- `Delivery_person_Ratings`  
- `Order_Date`  
- `Type_of_order`  
- `Type_of_vehicle`  
- `City`  
- `Time_taken (min)`  
- `Distance_km` *(calculated)*  
- `Packaging_type` *(added)*  
- `CO2_Emission` *(calculated)*  

Environmental fields were added manually using emission factors and packaging types.
